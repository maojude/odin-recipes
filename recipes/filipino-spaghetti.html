    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The difference between Italian spaghetti and Filipino spaghetti is the addition of <strong>banana</strong> ketchup, which makes this a rather <em>sweet</em> dish. Oh, and I almost forgot the <strong>hot dogs!</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (26.5 ounce) can spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) jar banana ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 pound hot dogs, sliced diagonally</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. </li>
        <li>Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the beef and pork; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the meat has browned.</li>
        <li>Pour in the spaghetti sauce, banana ketchup, sugar, and water. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in hot dog slices and continue to cook until hot dogs are heated through. </li>
        <li>Serve over spaghetti with Cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.</li>
    </ol>
